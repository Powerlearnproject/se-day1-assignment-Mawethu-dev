Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is all about writing instructions for computers, building apps,games and websites aslso fix bugs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
you need to know programming language like HTML,CSS,javascript,java, dart &flutter so that you can become a software engineer 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning,Requirement analysis, design,development (coding),testing,deployment amnd maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
collaborate and contribute positively to a group dynamics

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
helps programmers develop software code effectively 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
to many bugs to fix 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is like talking to AI where by you give AI a task to do something and AI responds to it (a set of commands and questions)
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
IF you want AI to do exactly what you need ,  youn must know how to talk to it
